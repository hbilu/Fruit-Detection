This project identifies fruits from a live camera feed, marking each fruit with its name and detection score by drawing bounding boxes around them.

At present, the dataset includes 1745 images spanning 4 classes, resulting in approximately 5000 instances. 
Training was conducted using YOLOv9, and the model is available as the "best.pt" file.
